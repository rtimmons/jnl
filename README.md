# JNL: Directories of Text Files for Daily Work

`jnl` is a set of small scripts to help manage daily worklogs and unsorted scratch files all stored as plaintext.

Actual code is implemented in ugly n00b Python because the code is stupid simple. Important thing is the idea here ðŸ’ƒ

## Overview and Installation

    cd ..wherever-you-keep-your-projects..

    # Create your Journal Database. Choose whatever or location you'd like. Dropbox works okay.
    mkdir Journal
    # Setup environment variables
    # bash:
    echo "export JNL_DIR=$PWD/Journal" >> ~/.bashrc
    # zsh:
    echo "export JNL_DIR=$PWD/Journal" >> ~/.zshrc
    # optional: initialize it as a git repo
    git init Journal

    # Get the stupid jnl scripts
    git clone https://.../jnl.git

    # setup virtualenv
    # only need to do this once
    virtualenv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Add jnl to $PATH
    # bash:
    echo "export PATH=$PWD/jnl/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    # zsh
    echo "export PATH=$PWD/jnl/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc

Then run the various `bin` scripts like a boss.

There is a "Today's Worklog.app" Apple application. Copy or drag to your Applications directory and rename to end with `.app` to enable.  Funny extension so Spotlight/Alfred & crew don't see this on its own. This little app runs `jnl daily` to open today's worklog entry in TextMate (creating if not exists. You can modify it with *Script Editor.app* by dragging it in.

(I cannot recall where I got the cute 'moleskine' icon for the .app. It's entirely possible I stole it and it's copyrighted and you could get into lots of trouble for seeing it. Possibly it's [one of these](http://pica-ae.deviantart.com/art/Moleskine-Icons-91551480)?)

To change the application for opening files, modify the code - see `open -a TextMate.app` for instance.


## Daily & Worklog Files

These files are organized into a "database" which is just a folder. When you run the `jnl` scripts, they look for the `JNL_DIR` environment variable for the path to that folder. If not set, the `testdb` directory within this repo will be used so you can play with `jnl`s features or debug while making changes.

There are two kinds of files `jnl` knows about: 

1.  "daily" files

    -   Use `jnl today` to open the current day's file (and create it if it doesn't exist)
    -   You can create at most one per day (`jnl today` looks for an existing item for today before creating a new one).
    -   Daily files are just like regular worklog files, they just have a `@quick(daily/$yyyymmdd)` tag so they get symlinked to `quick/daily/$yyyymmdd.txt`.

    I use daily files for jotting down things I did, links to pull-requests I created, for putting meeting notes, etc.

2.  "worklog" files

    -   Create them ad-hoc. They're cheap and lightweight to create and manage.
    -   Worklog files live in `$JNL_DIR/worklogs`
    -   Use `jnl new` to create a new worklog file and open in TextMate
    -   New files have a random "guid"-esque filename. They are not intended to be sorted by name, but you may want to sort them by date when you open the directory up in Finder to find files

    Create them ad-hoc for composing text, saving snippets of code, drafting ideas, or as buffer space. 

    I like to give myself free-reign to save anything at all into worklog files; I don't treat each one as being important.  Once in the habit of saving random text to worklogs it's very easy to throw one-off shell commands or script output or whatever and search for them later.

## Tags 

**`@quick`**:

If you have the line `@quick(some-text)`, the `jnl scan` command will create
symlinks in the `$JNL_DIR/quick` directory to those files.

E.g. If the file `MC289YWD6EWRWPYCMTJD.txt` has the contents
`quick(2016-resolutions)`, then running `jnl scan` will result in a symlink
`quick/2016-resolutions.txt` pointing to `MC289YWD6EWRWPYCMTJD.txt`.

Subdirectories work. E.g. `@quick(project-overviews/my-project)`, and `jnl scan` will create a symlink in the `quick/project-overviews` directory (creating it as necessary). This is how "daily" files are managed.

**`@ft`**

I like to compose text in FoldingText. Add the tag `@ft` and it will set the OSX "Open With" attribute such that the file opens with FoldingText when double-clicked or `open`ed. You could change this to some other program with a small tweak.

**`@noscan`**

`jnl` reads the entire directory a lot. If you have big files with a bunch of garbage, you can use the `@noscan` tag. As soon as the DB reader sees `@noscan` it doesn't continue reading a file, but the file is treated like a normal entry otherwise (so tags before this one are respected).

## DayOne Conversion

I used to use DayOne.app for my daily files but it's a pain. But you can export your DayOne journal to plaintext and then use `misc/convert-from-dayone` to convert the entires to daily entries.

Then use `misc/dxx-convert.sh` to convert from old-style `dxx-yyyymmdd.txt` files to new-style `worklogs/$guid.txt` files with tags.

## Git and Backup

Don't keep your db folder in this repo, create a new git repo for it. I like to use `~/Journal`. See above.

I like to create a "backup" remote on an external drive and set it up to mirror my local journal repo. So I can just do `git push backup`.

## Local Dev Setup

I can't remember how I setup virtualenv. Do that first. Below is notes I took but probably not right....

```sh
# ensure latest command-line tools
xcode-select --install

brew install openssl
brew install python3

# follow steps to install pyenv https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
brew install pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" \
    pyenv install -v 2.7.10

pip install -r requirements.txt

# something, something, something to install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 envname
```

Then restart your shell (what is this, windows?!).


## Test

```sh
# after setting up virtualenv and pip installing
pytest
```
